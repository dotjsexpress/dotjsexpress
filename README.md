## 🎓 Project: The Alumni Router

### Bridging the Gap Between Institutions and Alumni

**The Alumni Router** is a secure, centralized, and user-friendly platform designed to manage alumni data and improve engagement after graduation. Currently, many educational institutions rely on outdated or informal systems such as WhatsApp groups or mailing lists. This leads to scattered data and weak alumni relationships.

We aim to revolutionize the way institutions and alumni interact by offering a modern solution that supports networking, mentorship, events, and donations.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
